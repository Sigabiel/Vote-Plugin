# VotePlugin
 OpenSource plugin, which can handle player votes on different services.
 
# Important
 When you're using the plugin you have to change the key in the [Config](https://github.com/Sigabiel/VotePlugin/blob/master/src/config.yml) file.
 
# Vote Event
 I created a own Voteevent which is called every time a player is voting for the server. If you want to use
 it look in the [WIKI](https://github.com/Sigabiel/VotePlugin/wiki).
