# VotePlugin
 OpenSourcesystem which can handle player votes on different services
 
# Important
 When you're using the plugin you have to change the key in the [Config](https://github.com/Sigabiel/VotePlugin/blob/master/src/config.yml) File
 
# Vote Event
 I created a own Vote Event which is called every time a player is voting for the server. If you want to use
 it look in the WIKI.
